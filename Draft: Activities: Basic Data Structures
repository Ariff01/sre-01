Activity 1
Prompt the user to answer a series of 3-5 questions about themselves (such as their name, their age, their birthday, or where they live)
and save the answers in a list. Display the results to the user.
name=input("What is your name?")
age=int(input("What is your age?"))
add=input("Where do you stay?")
q=[name,age,add]
print(q)

Activity 2
Present the user with an existing list of items (such as the list created in the previous activity) and 
prompt the user for 2-4 more items to add to the list. Update the list with the new items and display the updated list.
print(q)
print("What is your name")


Activity 3
Present the user with a list of 7-9 items (such as the list created in the previous activities) and prompt them to enter one item to delete from the list. Delete the named item from the list and display the updated list.

Activity 4
Present the user with a list of 7-9 items (such as the list created in the previous activities) and prompt them to select one item from the list to update, along with the new value for that item. Change the item's value and display the new list to the user.

Tip: Use Google Search or another search engine to find out how to identify the index value of a specific item in a list.

Activity 5
Create four tuples:

One tuple with a person's first name and last name
A second tuple with the person's current profession
A third tuple with the person's current address
A fourth tuple with the person's previous address
Combine all tuples into a new, single tuple that contains all items from the original tuples.

Activity 6
Using the final tuple from the previous activity, write a program that performs the following steps:

Display the tuple to the user.
Prompt the user to enter a value that should be changed.
Prompt the user to enter the updated value for that item.
Update the value and display the updated tuple to the user.
