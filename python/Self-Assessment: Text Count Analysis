Step 1: Normalize the Letter Casing
s = """Imagine a vast sheet of paper on which straight Lines, Triangles, Squares, Pentagons, Hexagons, and other figures, instead of remaining fixed in their places, move freely about, on or in the surface, but without the power of rising above or sinking below it, very much like shadows - only hard and with luminous edges - and you will then have a pretty correct notion of my country and countrymen. Alas, a few years ago, I should have said "my universe": but now my mind has been opened to higher views of things."""
 
    #do not change any code above this line
    #your code here
sl=s.lower()

Step 2: Split the String into Words
words = list() #do not delete. this list must contain the list of words. 
 
#your code goes here
words=sl.split() 
print(words) #do not delete 
#do not write any code past here

Step 3: Count the Words
len(words)

Step 4: Count the Distinct Words
len(set(words))

Step 5: Compute the Word Frequencies
freq_occur = dict()
for word in words:
    if word in freq_occur.keys():
       freq_occur[word]+=1
    else:
       freq_occur[word]=1
       
Step 6: Remove Punctuation Marks
 import string #import the string module 
    #use the built-in string.punctuation method to create a list of all punctuation marks
    punctuation_list =  list(string.punctuation)

    print(words)
    w_clean = list() 

 
    #your code goes here 
    for i in words:
      for j in i:  
        if j in punctuation_list:
          i=i.replace(j,'')
          print(i) 
      if len(i)>1:
        w_clean.append(i)
        
    
 
    print(w_clean)
    print(len(w_clean))
    
    step 7=all code combined
