Disk Space

Run a command to see the disk usage across your file system.
df 

Run the command again. This time ensure the output is in human-readable format and added to a file named filesystem.usage in your home directory.
df -h > ~/filesystem.usage

Show the disk usage for your home directory.
du ~

Show the disk usage for your home directory in human-readable format and add it a file named disk.usage in your home directory.
du -h ~ > ~/disk.usage

Run a disk check specifically showing output for all files and folders in human-readable format. Put the results into usage2 in your home directory.
du -ah ~ > ~/disk.usage

Show the disk usage for everything in /var.
du -h /var

Run a disk usage command on your home directory that will follow any links if you have them set up and display the output in human-readable format.
du -Lh ~

Create a folder named disk in your home directory.
mkdir disk

Copy your output files from exercise 2, exercise 4, and exercise 5 into this folder.
cp ex2 ex4 ex5 disk

Move into the disk folder.
mv ex2 ex4 ex5 disk

Run a command to create an archive tar file named disk.tar that includes everything in this folder.
tar cvf disk.tar disk

Reverse the previous command and undo the archive.
tar xvf disk.tar 

Now run an archive of these files to ensure it creates a g-zipped tarball named disk.tar.gz in a single-line command.
tar cvzf disk.tar.gz disk

Create an empty file named newdisk in this directory.
touch newdisk

Uncompress the gz file you created so that it is back to being just a tar file.
tar xvzf disk.tar

Add the newdisk file to the tar file.
tar rvf disk.tar.gz newdisk

Compress the tar file again to make a g-zipped tarball again.
tar czvf disk.tar.gz disk.tar

Create another directory named disk_output in your home directory.
mkdir disk_output

Uncompress your tarball to the directory you just created.
ta xvzf disk.tar.gz ./disk_output

Go back to your home directory and run a command to g-zip your disk_output directory. Ensure it recursively compresses everything.
tar cvzf disk_output.tar.gz ./disk_output
