Splunk is used for log analysis 

data input to forwarders send data to indexer to be stored
and accessed by search heads to use for alerts/reporting etc. 

deployer issues config updates to search heads/cluster members

cluster master monitors the indexers/peer nodes
and manages the search heads to access specific indexers 
through the captain of the search heads cluster

deployment server similar job as deployer but is for forwarders
e.g. config updates for forwarders 

------------------------------------------------------
Summary for splunk config(will require more depth)

1. Setup fowarder instance(FI) and cluster master instance (CMI)
2. Link FI to CMI through a port,e.g 9997

3. (change port to listening state for input)
e.g. in CMI, ./splunk enable listen 9997
 
4. Add the log file which is to be fowarded to which indexer as well 
e.g in FI, ./splunk add monitor <logfile> -index main -sourcetype "nameofmonitoring"

*p.s: use ./splunk assuming you are already in the directory which has the splunk file)
*GUI available for CMI,not FI(both can access through CLI)

**not yet researched on how to add the logfile from a particular server instance's logfile for 
<logfile> implementation in 2.2.Which will be the EXB services etc; in JPM context 




Splunk cmd
index="main"(see step 4.) - shows logs as events in the index called main as configured
