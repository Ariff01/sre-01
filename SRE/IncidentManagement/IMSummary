INCIDENT MANAGEMENT

IT Service Management framework ITIL defines an incident as:
An unplanned interruption of a service, or reduction in the quality of a service

Incident management plan
Clearly describe the issue
• How detected or who manually triggered the incident
• Date and time the incident was reported
• Description of the incident
• Incident category
• Level of the incident

Incident management process

-Identify key roles and clear chain of command

-Define responsibilities

-Capture response efforts for future analysis and learning

-Communicate

Well defined and rehearsed Incident Management Process
• Faster incident resolution (MTTR = Mean time
to restore, repair, respond or recovery)
• Reduced costs and/or revenue loss
• Improved internal/external communications
• Continuous improvement and learning

Managed by objectives
-Establish measurable objectives for the response
Strategies
Tactics
Tasks
Activities

-Issue assignments in a specific and timeboxed manner

-Monitoring the results of the incident tasks

Incident Management Key Roles
Incident Manager
Deputy
Scribe

Operations Lead
Communications Lead
Planning Lead

Incident Commander
Responsible for overall coordination
• Keeps incident moving towards resolution
Coordinates all the other roles
• De facto holder of any roles not delegated to
others
Delegates tasks
• Should not be personally making changes
Only role always filled

Scribe
Assists IC
• Captures communication

Focus on capturing all information
for future use

Operations Lead
Works with the IC
• Develop theories about what is broken and why
• Recommend changes to the IC
• Coordinate the operation team's efforts to
restore the service
Makes sure changes are made in a controlled
manner
Makes sure that only operation teams are making
changes to the system
Brings in subject matter experts (SMEs) to assist

Communications Lead
Communications are critical
• Internal
• External
Periodic updates
• Status page
• Social media

- Loss of income
- Penalties
- Fines
• Regulatory
- Legal risk

An incident postmortem brings people together to discuss the details of an incident: 
Why it happened
Impact
Actions taken to mitigate it and resolve it
What should be done to prevent it from happening again

Distinguish betweeen blameful and blameless postmortem
Calling out of individuals discouraged, blameless path, to allow for less tension and more truthful documentation 

Risk embracing is encouraged since every system is bound to fail, better to be prepared for it

Complexity of system guarantees hardware failure
-Cloud 
Security attacks
-Organization may or may not know they have been attacked
Database corruption
Component update
-Behave unexpectedly

Respone to failure 
-Plan
-Learn
-Practice


ALert fatugue can lead to burnout during on call rotations 
-result in productivity decline 

Reduce Toil
-Tasks that are toil don’t provide a lot of value. Rather, they keep engineers from progressing with product and service development
-If teams spend the majority of their time on these tasks, they have less time for high-value work. This prohibits innovation

Update Alerts
Eliminate false positives
Improve information that accompanies alert
Point to likely resources for faster fix
Assign some alerts to automate ticket generation
Focus on those that need immediate human intervention
