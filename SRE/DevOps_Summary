DevOps in a team is the collabration and continuous integration of various feedbacks in software development. 
It complements the Agile methodology used in teams from planning to deployment stages which are split 
in iterations to focus on sub projects for the main deployment of the underlying product. Each iteration last 2-8 weeks, usually on the lower end. 
There is a dynamic feedback loop to allows for contant changes within the iterations, for a less risk on approach
as compared to having to troubleshoot at the complete end phase, which can be tedious and costly. The waterfall approach which does nto have the feedback loop 
as the agile methodology is more useful for vague projects that does not require micro managed changes. 
Devops is not a tool or a title, it is a practice used in software development and the tools used in this practice,such as Git,Docker,Jenkins etc.
are highly versatile to enable integration in a team for a smooth operation.
